# Emotion Classification from Sound Events 

## Overview

This project aims to classify emotions from sound events using machine learning techniques. It leverages two datasets â€” **EmoSounds** and **IADSED** which include acoustic features like pitch, rhythm, timbre, and tonal characteristics. Emotions are predicted based on **arousal** and **valence** dimensions, categorized into four classes.

We implemented and evaluated three models:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

Performance was assessed using **accuracy** and **macro F1-score**, with preprocessing techniques like feature scaling, SMOTE balancing, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) applied to improve model effectiveness.

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Dataset Preprocessing
- Drop nulls (IADSED)
- Scale features (range: `[-1, 1]`)
- Generate emotion labels:
  - `Class 0`: +Arousal, +Valence
  - `Class 1`: +Arousal, -Valence
  - `Class 2`: -Arousal, -Valence
  - `Class 3`: -Arousal, +Valence
- Balance classes using **SMOTE**

### Step 2: Feature Selection
- Apply **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** with **Random Forest**

### Step 3: Model Training
Train the following models:
- Logistic Regression (efficient baseline)
- Random Forest (ensemble of decision trees)
- XGBoost (gradient boosting)

### Step 4: Evaluation
- **Accuracy**
- **Macro F1-score**

## Key Insights

- **Random Forest** offered the best generalization, with solid performance across both datasets.
- **XGBoost** had the highest training accuracy but signs of overfitting.
- **Logistic Regression** showed the smallest gap between training and test performance but lower overall scores.
